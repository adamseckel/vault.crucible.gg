Known Issues:

* iPad drag and drop freezes when crossing columns
* Legendary Mods not showing up properly?
* Can't transfer an equiped item to another character or the vault

Roadmap:

* Option to maximize light
* Sort Items by power level
* Postmaster
* 'Profile Inventory' Management (i.e. mods and shaders between ALL CHARACTERS and VAULT)
* STATS Page for global usage metrics, items owned, most equipped items, etc
